Generic Data Organizer and Post-Processor

It is a simple tool developed in Matlab App Designer with some basic features which can be extended according to specific requirements 

This tool is useful if you:

    - perform experiments systematically and collect large amount of data
    - want to create a database with all performed tests while keeping track of selected experiment parameters
    - want to avoid repetitive manual labour for post-processing data and generating plots
    - want to be consistent in terms of the processing of data when more than one person is using the test equipment 
    - want to have the data all in one place

All the above points are also valid if the data is generated from numerical simulations
